# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
1. My confidence is still pretty shaky with for `for` statements. I need some work on them but I can feel myself improving every time I practice.
2. I think I had a fairly productive struggle, for a while I got extremely frustrated and had to walk away for a bit but once I came back to it and asked my peers for some advice I eventually figured it out.
3. I really need to practice everything pertaining to `for` statements, I need to set aside some time tomorrow morning to get a little more practice in.
4. I'm still pretty unclear on how to set the conditions that I want, I don't know how to articulate myself in Javascript just yet.
